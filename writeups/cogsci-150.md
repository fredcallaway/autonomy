In many of the decisions people make every day, there are far more possible outcomes than we can reasonably evaluate. How do we decide which to consider and which to ignore? Previous research has suggested two seemingly conflicting ideas. On the one hand, people might focus on extreme events (Lichtenstein et al. 1978, JEP; Lieder et al. 2018, Psych Rev). On the other hand, people might preferentially consider outcomes that are good (Icard et al. 2018, CogSci; Ongchoco et al. 2019, CogSci; Bear et al. 2020, Cognition). We propose that this discrepancy can be resolved by considering the amount of control the decision-maker has. Using mathematical and computational modeling, we show that a resource-rational decision-maker interpolates between sampling extreme vs. valuable outcomes when she has little vs. complete control over which outcome ultimately occurs. We re-interpret previous findings in light of these results.
