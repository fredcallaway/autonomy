- All but two participants correctly stated that they couldn't choose not to eat the fruit. The other two didn't answer the question.
- A cursory glance at the free response indicates that (almost) everyone gets it. See [Free-response comprehension check].
- For now we are not excluding anyone.
- This gives us N = `r nrow(pdf)`.



# Consideration probability by outcome value

How does the probability of an item being included in the considered set
depend on its value (measured by post-decision rating)? We predict that it
will depend on both signed and absolute value.

```{r}
BASELINE = mean(df$evaluation)
check_plot = df %>% 
    ggplot(aes(evaluation, as.numeric(considered), color=control)) +
    stat_summary_bin(fun.data=mean_cl_boot, bins=5, alpha=0.3, 
                     position=position_dodge(width=.5)) +
    geom_smooth(se=F, size=0.8, linetype = "dotted", alpha=0.3) +
    # geom_smooth(se=F, method=lm, formula=y ~ x + abs(x), alpha=0.1) +
    geom_smooth(se=F, method=glm, 
        formula=y ~ x + abs(x - 0),
        method.args = list(family = "binomial"),
        alpha=0.1) +
    ylab("consideration probability") +
    control_colors
check_plot
```

Basic prediction: ✅ (never has this emoji been more appropriate)

Reading the plot: points show binned means with 95% CI error bars. The dashed
line shows a non-parameteric [GAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model)
fit. The solid line shows a logistic regression of the form
$\text{logit}(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 |x|$. This is an adaptation
of the earlier apples/oranges version of our model.

It's not exactly what we predict, but this looks like a win. Visually, we see
effects of both signed and absolute value and we see that the effect of signed
value is greater in the high-control condition.

Unfortunately, the regression coefficients don't look as good...

```{r, fig.height=2}
consideration_model = df %>% 
    glm(considered ~ control * (zscore(evaluation) + zscore(abs(evaluation))), family=binomial, data=.)

plot_coefs(consideration_model, omit.coefs=c("controlhigh", "(Intercept)"), colors="black") #plot
summ(consideration_model)
```

The zscoring here is to make the estimates more directly comparable.
Based on the plot, I was hoping to see an interaction between high control
and signed value. It's trending in the right direction, but the 
interaction with absolute value is much stronger. If anything, we would expect
that the low-control condition would have a stronger effect of absolute
value (i.e., we predict a negative interaction.)


## By scenario 

Breaking things down by scenario, we see that we get the biggest difference in
the ZOO case. This makes sense because only this scenario has a large number
of extreme negative outcomes. However, even here, high-control participants
still think of negative outcomes.

```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=3}
check_plot + facet_wrap(~scenario)  # plot
```

Why do people think of negative outcomes when they are impossible to occur?
This could be due to a weak manipulation. However, it could also be that
people have a default sampling policy that is sensitive to both signed
and absolute value (as would be adaptive in cases of moderate control) and
they have only a limited ability to modulate that policy based on contextual
factors. The latter hypothesis is consistent with Fiery's previous work.
[Implications for the model] are discussed below.


👉 see [Alternative basic predictions] for analyses that treat consideration
as the IV (as I originally proposed).

👉 see [Z-scoring] for these analyses with evaluations z-scored within participant.
(This one is particulary worth checking out).

👉 There is mixed evidence for learning, documented in [Order effects].


# Value distributions

To better understand the effect of scenario, we need to look at the underlying
distributions of outcome values. Here we are plotting the distribution of all
outcome values in gray and the distribution of considered outcomes in blue and
yellow.


```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4}

df %>% 
    ggplot(aes(evaluation, y=..prop..)) + 
    geom_bar(alpha=0.7, data=df) +
    geom_bar(aes(fill=control), filter(df, considered), alpha=0.7) +
    facet_grid(control ~ scenario) + control_colors
```

Several comments here:

- People are not using the scale in the way we would like. In particular, they
  seem to really like the end points. As a result, absolute value is not really
  a good indicator of extremity. For example, there are more +10 responses for
  eating a fruit than there are -10 responses for being locked in a cage with
  a semi-wild animal. See [Next steps] for further discussion.
- "Extreme" high values are more likely to be considered in both conditions.
- We see our prediction fairly well in the ZOO scenario, although we do still
  see a lot of -10 responses in the high control condition.
- The differences in the other scenarios are minimal. However, it's worth noting
  that the model doesn't predict a strong effect of condition when value and
  extremity align, as is true in both VACTATION and (surprisingly) FRUIT.
  There is a hint of more consideration of negative VACATION destinations in
  the low-control case.

## Individual differences

We hope that most people have similar outcome value distributions for each problem.
First, we can look at the raw distributions for the first 12 participants.

<!-- For all the analyses in this section, we exclude participant-generated outcomes
that weren't in the pre-defined list (about 2.5%) -->

```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=5}

pid = "VACATION"
for (pid in unique(df$scenario)) {
    df %>% 
        # filter(outcome != "UNK") %>% 
        filter(subj <= 12 & scenario == pid) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(as_factor(evaluation))) +
            geom_bar() +
            facet_wrap(~ subj) +
            theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
            ggtitle(pid)
    fig(pid, 7.5, 5)
}
```

### Moments

It looks like there is a lot of variability. To get a higher-level
view, we can take all the outcomes generated in each trial and compute
the first three moments of that empirical distribution. Each moment
becomes a dot in this plot:

```{r,fig.width=7.5, fig.height=3.5}
df %>% 
    # filter(outcome != "UNK") %>% 
    group_by(scenario, wid) %>% 
    summarise(across(evaluation, list(μ=mean, σ=sd, skew=skewness), .names="{fn}"))  %>% 
    pivot_longer(μ:skew, names_to="moment", values_to="value") %>% 
    mutate(moment = recode_factor(moment, "μ" = "mean", "σ" = "sd")) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(scenario, value)) + 
        # geom_violin() +
        geom_quasirandom(size=.8) +
        stat_summary(fun.data=mean_cl_boot, color="red") +
        facet_wrap(~moment, scales="free") +
        scale_x_discrete(label=abbreviate, name=NULL)
```

This suggests to me that we are getting a meaningful manipulation on
the outcome-value distributions. There's still a lot of variability here,
but I'm not sure whether that is real individual differences or measurement
error. 

Here's a version of the above plot, with lines showing participants. This
shows that people are fairly consistent in how mean and sd vary across the
scenarios, although there are individual-specific offsets. Skew is pretty
messy here. It also looks completely different than how I intended (positive
for VACATION and negative for ZOO). In retrospect, it makes sense that skew
would go in the opposite direction as mean due to boundary effects on the -10
to 10 scale.


```{r,fig.width=7.5, fig.height=3.5}
df %>% 
    # filter(outcome != "UNK") %>% 
    group_by(scenario, wid) %>% 
    summarise(across(evaluation, list(μ=mean, σ=sd, skew=skewness), .names="{fn}"))  %>% 
    pivot_longer(μ:skew, names_to="moment", values_to="value") %>% 
    mutate(moment = recode_factor(moment, "μ" = "mean", "σ" = "sd")) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(scenario, value)) + 
        # geom_violin() +
        geom_hline(yintercept=0, size=0.5, linetype="dashed") +
        geom_line(aes(group=wid), alpha=0.5, size=0.5) +
        stat_summary(fun.data=mean_cl_boot, color="red") +
        facet_wrap(~moment, scales="free") +
        scale_x_discrete(label=abbreviate, name=NULL)
```

# Quality/sanity checks


## Higher outcome evaluations in high-control

Perhaps the most obvious and basic prediction one could make is that
the scenarios should be rated more highly in the high control condition.

```{r, fig.width=6}
scenarios %>% 
    ggplot(aes(scenario, scenario_evaluation, color=control)) +
    stat_summary(fun.data=mean_cl_boot, position=position_dodge(width=.8)) +
    geom_quasirandom(size=.8, dodge.width=.8, alpha=0.5) + control_colors

```
```{r, fig.height=2.5}
scenarios %>% lmer(scenario_evaluation ~ control * scenario + (1|wid), data=.) %>% plot_coefs(colors="black")
```

Sort of? The fact that we actually see higher ratings for low-control in
VACATION is puzzling. It might be that participants in the low-control
condition just happen to have higher individual offsets (i.e., they would 
be higher in all the scenarios if there wasn't a manipulation).


## Outcome evaluations predict scenario evaluations

Evaluations of the full scenario should depend on evaluations of individual
outcomes of that scenario.

```{r}
X = df %>% 
    group_by(control, wid, scenario) %>% 
    summarise(outcome_evaluation = mean(evaluation)) %>% 
    left_join(select(scenarios, control, wid, scenario, scenario_evaluation))

X %>% ggplot(aes(outcome_evaluation, scenario_evaluation)) +
    stat_summary_bin(fun.data=mean_cl_boot, bins=5, position=position_dodge(width=1), alpha=0.3) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

🎊 woop dee doo 🎊

What we really want to see is that the outcome evaluations predict scenario evaluations
_over and above_ the scenario and participant offsets. That is, the outcome evaluations
should provide some signal about the interaction between participant and scenario.

To test this, we'll use within-participant z-scored evaluations (both outcome
and scenario) and we'll separate by scenario. Note that the `_z` suffix will
always indicate within-participant z-scoring. See [Z-scoring] for more information.

```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4}
X = df %>% 
    group_by(wid, scenario, considered) %>% 
    summarise(outcome_evaluation_z = mean(evaluation_z)) %>% 
    left_join(select(scenarios, wid, scenario, scenario_evaluation_z)) 

X %>% ggplot(aes(outcome_evaluation_z, scenario_evaluation_z)) +
    stat_summary_bin(fun.data=mean_cl_boot, bins=5, position=position_dodge(width=1), alpha=0.7) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm", alpha=0.2) +
    facet_wrap(~scenario)
    # facet_wrap(~control, labeller=label_glue("{control} control")) + 

X %>% lm(scenario_evaluation_z ~ 0 + outcome_evaluation_z + scenario, data=.) %>% summ
```

OK that's good...

## Are considered outcomes more important?

...but what we'd _really_ like to see is that the evaluations are specifically sensitive
to the _considered_ outcomes (vs. the unconsidered outcomes). Unfortunately, this does
not seem to be the case.

```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=4}


X = df %>% 
    mutate(considered=if_else(considered, "considered", "unconsidered")) %>% 
    group_by(wid, scenario, considered) %>% 
    summarise(outcome_evaluation_z = mean(evaluation_z)) %>% 
    left_join(select(scenarios, wid, scenario, scenario_evaluation_z)) 

X %>% ggplot(aes(outcome_evaluation_z, scenario_evaluation_z, color=considered, fill=considered)) +
    stat_summary_bin(fun.data=mean_cl_boot, bins=5, position=position_dodge(width=1), alpha=0.3) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm", alpha=0.1) +
    facet_wrap(~scenario) + 
    theme(legend.position="top") +
    considered_colors

X1 = df %>% 
    group_by(wid, scenario, considered) %>% 
    summarise(y = mean(evaluation_z)) %>% 
    mutate(x=if_else(considered, "considered_val", "unconsidered_val")) %>% 
    select(-considered) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    pivot_wider(names_from=x, values_from=y, names_repair="unique") %>% 
    right_join(scenarios)

X1 %>% lm(scenario_evaluation_z ~ considered_val + unconsidered_val + scenario, data=.) %>% summ
```

Ouch. It looks like the considered values are selectively _not_
contributing to the overall scenario evaluation. And yes I did check my
response coding. 😉

But before we throw up our hands in despair, it's important to note that there
are many more unconsidered outcomes than considered outcomes, and so the mean
of the latter is a much noisier measure. If we just look at the relationship
between individual outcome evaluations and the total scenario evaluation, we
do see that the considered outcomes have a slightly stronger relationship.

```{r}
df %>% 
    inner_join(select(scenarios, -considered)) %>% 
    group_by(considered) %>% 
    nest() %>%
    mutate(result = map(data, function(.) {
        m = lm(scenario_evaluation_z ~ evaluation_z + scenario, data=.)
        tibble(
            slope = m$coef["evaluation_z"],
            cor = with(., cor(evaluation_z, scenario_evaluation_z, use='complete'))
        )
    })) %>% 
    unnest(result) %>%
    select(-data) %>% kable
```

To be honest, I don't fully understand how the slope can be steeper in this
regression but less steep in the plots. I think it must be because in the
plotted regressions, we have one observations per trial, whereas in the
table regression, we have one observation per outcome. I'm not sure which
is a better test; or perhaps there is a third way.

Even if we trust the second (more positive) set of results, the conclusion is
not especially optimistic. It seems pretty likely that either (1) the scenario
evaluations are really based on a gist-like perception of the situation rather
than aggregations of separate outcome samples, and/or (2) the outcomes
participants report having considered are not a veridicial measure of what
they actually thought about.

## Number of options considered

This is pretty self-explanatory. Overall, it seems like we are getting
pretty decent rates.

```{r}
scenarios %>% 
    ggplot(aes(n_considered, y=..prop..)) + geom_bar()

```

### By participant
```{r,fig.width=7.5, fig.height=3}
scenarios %>% 
    group_by(wid) %>% 
    mutate(nc = mean(n_considered)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    mutate(wid = fct_reorder(wid, desc(nc))) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(wid, n_considered)) + 
        stat_summary(geom="line", group=0, color="red", alpha=0.5) +
        geom_point(alpha=0.5) + 
        xlab("participant") +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= breaks_pretty(6)) +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

### Over time
```{r}
scenarios %>% 
    plot_line_range(trial_number, n_considered) + 
    geom_quasirandom(size=1) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks= breaks_pretty(6)) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks= breaks_pretty(3))

```

# Discussion

Overall, I think the results are promising enough to warrant further efforts
with this paradigm.

## Implications for the model

The model being fit to the first set of plots is very similar to our initial
"apples/oranges" mixture model. The fits are pretty darn good, suggesting
that a model like the initially proposed model will be able to fit the data well.

In contrast, if we look at the predictions from the 
[analytic maximum of Gaussians model](http://fredcallaway.com/reports/autonomy/inf_choose_k-21-01-22.html#adding-uws),
we see that for even moderate $k$, the probability of sampling extreme
low-value outcomes is very small. Of course, these outcome distributions are
highly non-Gaussian; accounting for that in the model could change things.
Specifically, we can construct a sampling distribution based on the empirical
CDF of values in the scenario or perhaps a parametric approximation such as the
[skew Normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_normal_distribution). Two challenges
with this approach:

- It's not clear how to account for the value distribution without making unrealistic
  assumptions about people's pre-sampling knowledge of that distribution. This would be
  like the issue with presupposing the mean for UWS, but also for higher moments.
- The model will have less flexibility in how it can capture partial adaptation. We have
  the $k$ parameter of course, but these results suggest that people are asymetric in their
  ability to increase positive outcome sampling vs. reduce negative outcome sampling 
  (in particular, see the ZOO panel in [By scenario]). I think this will be difficult to
  capture in any model that _composes_ UWS with value-weighted sampling as opposed to having
  two separate and independently controllable mechansisms.

Here's another approach, using the apples/oranges mixture model as a base:

For each scenario:

1. Identify optimal weights on signed vs absolute value.
2. Estimate best-fitting weights from human data.
3. Compare, drawing inferences about people's sensitivity to various components of
  the distribution and ability to modulate different aspects of their sampling poloicy.

Based on these results, we will hopefully be able to specify structured models of the
contextual adaptation, allowing us to e.g. predict peoples sampling policies based
on properties of distribution rather than fitting the weights for each scenario.

I still think the analytic approach is theoretically more interesting and the
challenges are not necessarily insurmountale. The results with Z-scored evaluations
also seem to be more consistent with that model. However, the path forward with
the apples/oranges model is still more clear to me.

## Implications for the paradigm

### Issues with the scale

I think the biggest problem with the current results is that people are
clearly not using the sliders in a way that maps in any consistent way to an
underlying utility scale (see [Value distributions]). To address this, I
propose that we add a phase at the beginning of the experiment that tries to
teach participants to use the scale in the way we want them to. Something like
this:

> In this experiment you will be using a scale like the one below to rate many
> different hypothetical events. Please try to follow these guidelines when
> using the scale:
> 
> - If you would like the event to occur, give a postive number. 
>   If you would prefer it not to occur, give a negative nubmer. 
>   Give zero when you have no preference either way.
> - Use small numbers (e.g. -3 to 3) when you have a slight preference for the
>   event to (not) occur. Only use large numbers (less than -6 or more than 6)
>   when you feel very strongly about the event.
> - Try to be match negative and positive numbers. For example, if you rate event A as -3
>   and event B as +4, that means you would be willing to have A happen if it meant
>   that B would also happen (because 4 - 3 is more than zero).
> - Most importantly, try to be _consisent_ in your ratings. If you rate event A as
>   +4 and event B as +6, that should mean that you would prefer event B over event A.
>   Try to be consistent across the entire experiment, not just within sections.
> 
> Before we begin the experiment proper, please rate the following events,
> following the guidelines above. This will help give you a sense of the
> magnitude of events you might encounter in the experiment.
> 
> - Finding a $20 bill on the street
> - Missing your train and waiting 30 minutes for the next one
> - Breaking your arm in a car accident
> - Winning the lottery
> - ...


Another thing we can do is switch to using a Likert scale with fewer options
that are each given informative names. However, I think having a larger number
of possible responses might be necessary to capture variation in scenarios like
FRUIT as well as those like ZOO.

After having written this out, it occurs to me that we can't be the first
people who want participants to use a scale consistently. Are there standard
pratices here? My first instinct was to look at social/personality psychology
methods, but I think our model needs to make much stronger assumptions about
how people use the scale compared to the models typically employed in those
areas (e.g. ANOVAs).

### Controling for frequency/typicality

A brief point. If you check out the [Outcome-based analysis], you'll see that
consideration probaiblity is also highly dependent on something like typicality
(e.g. jaguar and crocodile are considered much less often than tiger and lion)
despite having similar value ratings. I think we will probably need to control
for this down the line. This will require running a norming experiment. I can
think of two ways to do this:

1. Ask people to list every instance of the group (e.g. list all the zoo animals
you can think of). 
2. Ask people to give a single example of the category.

The problem with the former is that we probably need to account for generation
order somehow and I'm not sure how to do that. The problem with the latter is
that it won't get coverage on the tails and it will be more expensive because
it would require lots of participants.


# Supporting information

## Order effects

Do participants get better at sampling in a manner consistent with their condition
over time?

```{r}
df %>% 
    # filter(scenario!="FRUIT") %>% 
    left_join(select(scenarios, wid, scenario, trial_number)) %>% 
    mutate(last_trial = as.numeric(trial_number==3)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(evaluation, as.numeric(considered), color=control)) +
    stat_summary_bin(fun.data=mean_cl_boot, bins=5, alpha=0.3, 
                     position=position_dodge(width=.5)) +
    geom_smooth(se=F, size=0.8, linetype = "dotted", alpha=0.3) +
    # geom_smooth(se=F, method=lm, formula=y ~ x + abs(x), alpha=0.1) +
    geom_smooth(se=F, method=glm, 
        formula=y ~ x + abs(x - 0),
        method.args = list(family = "binomial"),
        alpha=0.1) +
    ylab("consideration probability") +
    facet_grid(scenario ~ trial_number,  labeller = label_glue(
        cols = "trial {trial_number}",
        rows = "{scenario}"
    )) +
    control_colors
```

Note that all participants saw FRUIT first. For ZOO, it does look like
high-control participants do a better job of ignoring low-value outcomes.
However, VACATION gets a little worse. Given that there are two sets of 
participants here (one that sees VACATION first and one that sees ZOO first),
it seems likely to me that this is a coincidental alignment of individual
differences with order. But...

```{r, fig.height=3}
consideration_model_time = df %>% 
    left_join(select(scenarios, wid, scenario, trial_number)) %>% 
    # mutate(trial = trial_number - 1)
    # filter(scenario!="FRUIT") %>% 
    # mutate(last_trial = as.numeric(trial_number==3)) %>% 
    glm(considered ~ trial_number * control * (zscore(evaluation) + zscore(abs(evaluation))), family=binomial, data=.)

summ(consideration_model_time)
```

We do see a significant third-order interaction, such that high-control
participants attend to high- value outcomes more on later trials (second
to last row). The more model taking into account order has a better AIC:
`r round(consideration_model_time$aic)` vs `r round(consideration_model$aic)`.

## Alternative basic predictions

In this set of analyses, we treat consideration as an IV and ask how
signed/absoluate evaluations differ among considered vs. unconsidered
outcomes. I think these are superseded by the analyses in [Basic predictions]
but I'm putting them here for completeness.

### High control participants consider higher-value outcomes

We predict that participants in the high-control condition will consider
higher-valued outcomes than those in the low condition. This should be 
specific to considered outcomes---there should be no effect, or even a slight
negative effect of control on the value of _unconsidered_ outcomes. Thus,
we predict an interaction between consideration and control on evaluations.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
plot_line_range(df, considered, evaluation, control) + control_colors
```

```{r, fig.height=2}
df %>% 
    mutate(considered = as.numeric(considered)) %>% 
    lmer(evaluation ~ considered * control + (1|wid), data=.) %>% plot_coefs(colors="black")
```

(95% CI error bars)

It's not quite significant in the mixed effects regression, but visually, it
looks like we got it! We also see a very robust main effect, which suggests
a default policy for sampling good outcomes regardless of context.


### Low control participants consider extreme outcomes

Participants in the low-control condition should consider extreme outcomes.
Unclear what we predict about the high-control condition; it probably depends
on the outcome distribution...

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
plot_line_range(df, considered, abs(evaluation), control) + control_colors
```

```{r, fig.height=2}
df %>% 
    mutate(considered = as.numeric(considered)) %>% 
    lmer(abs(evaluation) ~ considered * control + (1|wid), data=.) %>% plot_coefs(colors="black")
```

Another strong main effect, as lots of previous research would suggest. We
get an interaction, but it's not in the direction I would have expected.

👉 See [Low control participants consider higher-variance outcomes] for a
similar analysis that yields oddly different results.

👉 See [Z-scoring] for both of these analyses with z-scored evaluations. The
results are a little better, but it's maybe questionable to do this with a
between-participant condition.

### Broken down by scenario

```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=3}
plot_line_range(df, considered, evaluation, control) + facet_wrap(~ scenario) + control_colors
plot_line_range(df, considered, abs(evaluation), control) + facet_wrap(~ scenario) + control_colors
```


### Low control participants consider higher-variance outcomes

The variance (or SD) of all considered outcomes should also be an indicator
of sampling extreme values, especially if there are extreme values on both
sides of the mean. We do see the predicted main effect, but we don't see
an interaction with consideration, so I'm not sure what to make of this.

```{r}
X = df %>% 
    group_by(control, wid, scenario, considered) %>%
    summarise(eval_sd = sd(evaluation)) 

X %>% plot_line_range(considered, eval_sd, control) + control_colors
```
```{r, fig.height=2}
X %>% lm(eval_sd ~ considered * control, data=.) %>% plot_coefs(colors="black")
```

```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=3}
X %>% plot_line_range(considered, eval_sd, control) + facet_wrap(~scenario) + control_colors
```
<!-- 
## Low control participants consider negative outcomes more

```{r}
df %>% 
    plot_line_range(considered, as.numeric(evaluation < 0), control)
    
```
 -->

## Z-scoring

Instead of using mixed effects, we can z-score the evaluations within participant.
This better accounts for individual differences in using the scale but it also
seems a little weird to do with a between-participant condition. That being said
there's no reason to think that control would affect evaluation of individual
outcomes, so this is probably fine.

<!-- To minimize the effect of condition on this normalization, we are only
including outcomes on the list of outcomes that everyone evaluated when
computing the mean and sd. -->

### Consideration probability

```{r}
check_plot_z = df %>% 
    # filter(abs(evaluation_z) < 2) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(evaluation_z, as.numeric(considered), color=control)) +
    stat_summary_bin(fun.data=mean_cl_boot, bins=5, alpha=0.3, 
                     position=position_dodge(width=.5)) +
    geom_smooth(se=F, size=0.8, linetype = "dotted", alpha=0.2) +
    # geom_smooth(se=F, method=lm, formula=y ~ x + abs(x), alpha=0.1) +
    geom_smooth(se=F, method=glm, 
        formula=y ~ x + abs(x - 0),
        method.args = list(family = "binomial"),
        alpha=0.1) +
    ylab("consideration probability") +
    control_colors
check_plot_z
```

```{r, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=3}
check_plot_z + facet_wrap(~scenario)  # plot
```

It's mysterious to me that these look so different from the non-zscored
versions. In particular, we now see much less consideration of low-value
outcomes, except in the low-control zoo.

And the regression:

```{r, fig.height=2}
consideration_model_z = df %>% 
    glm(considered ~ control * (zscore(evaluation_z) + zscore(abs(evaluation_z))), family=binomial, data=.)

plot_coefs(consideration_model_z, omit.coefs=c("controlhigh", "(Intercept)"), colors="black")
```

Overall this is more consistent with our model predictions. In particular, we now
get both interactions trending in the predicted directions. 
However the AIC is a lot worse with the z-scored evaluations
(`r round(consideration_model_z$aic)` vs. `r round(consideration_model$aic)`)
and I trust the raw values more given that I don't understand why z-scoring makes
such a big difference. I'm hoping that the divergence can be reduced by
encouraging people to use the scale more consistently. 🤞

### Alternative basic z-scored
This is _highly_ supplemental. I encourage skipping it.

#### Control -> value of considered outcomes
We now get a full cross over pattern and a significant interaction.

```{r}
plot_line_range(df, considered, evaluation_z, control) + control_colors
```

```{r, fig.height=2}
df %>% 
    mutate(considered = as.numeric(considered)) %>% 
    lm(evaluation_z ~ considered * control , data=.) %>% plot_coefs(colors="black")
```

#### Control -> absolute value of considered outcomes
In this case, the z-scored evaluations might make more sense because extremity
ought to be evaluated relative to a participant's baseline value. On the other hand,
it's not clear that the mean outcome evaluation in this experiment is really
a good measure of that baseline.

Interestingly, it makes a big difference for this analysis....

```{r}
plot_line_range(df, considered, abs(evaluation_z), control) + control_colors
```

```{r, fig.height=2}
df %>% 
    mutate(considered = as.numeric(considered)) %>% 
    lmer(abs(evaluation_z) ~ considered * control + (1|wid), data=.) %>% plot_coefs(colors="black")
```

This might merit further consideration 🤔 


## Outcome-based analysis

In the previous analyses we have operationalized outcome value by the participants
individual rating. We have effectively ignored the identity of outcome itself. What
if we instead assume that people have consistent preferences and use the average
evaluation across all participants. We use within-participant z-scored evaluations here.

We also exclude all outcomes not in our original set. These were fairly rare. 
```{r}
# unknown rate is low enought that we can ignore
df %>% 
    group_by(scenario, control) %>% 
    summarise(mean(outcome == "UNK")) %>% kable
```

(Side note: for all the previous analyses I've ignored the fact that the set of
rated outcomes is not identical for all participants (because of these extra 
considered outcomes. I'm not sure if that was the right call.)

First let's look at the outcome ratings themselves. The dark error bars show 95% CI
and the lighter bars show the SD to illustrate variability.

```{r, fig.height=9}
df %>% 
    filter(outcome != "UNK") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(evaluation_z, fct_reorder(outcome, evaluation_z, mean))) +
        stat_summary(fun.data=mean_sdl, fun.args = list(mult = 1), color="gray") + 
        stat_summary(fun.data=mean_cl_boot) + 
        facet_wrap(~ scenario, ncol=1, scales="free_y") + 
        geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed") +
        no_grid + ylab(NULL)

```

I am truly shocked that pineapple is rated so low...🍍😢

Distribution of considered outcomes, sorted by aggregate value looks
reasonable, but I think plotting by non-aggregate evaluation is more informative.

```{r, fig.height=9}
agg_eval = df %>% 
    filter(outcome != "UNK") %>% 
    group_by(outcome) %>% 
    mutate(
        agg_evaluation = mean(evaluation_z),
        outcome = fct_reorder(outcome, agg_evaluation)
    )

agg_eval %>% 
    filter(considered) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=..count.., y=fct_reorder(outcome, agg_evaluation))) + 
    geom_bar(aes(fill=control),  alpha=0.3, position="identity") +
    facet_wrap(~ scenario, ncol=1, scales="free_y") + control_colors + no_grid
```

Redoing the main analysis with the aggregate evalutions, we get a much noisier
pattern of results.

```{r}
agg_eval %>% ggplot(aes(agg_evaluation, as.numeric(considered), color=control)) +
    stat_summary_bin(fun.data=mean_cl_boot, bins=5, alpha=0.3, 
                     position=position_dodge(width=.1)) +
    geom_smooth(se=F, size=0.8, linetype = "dotted", alpha=0.3) +
    # geom_smooth(se=F, method=lm, formula=y ~ x + abs(x), alpha=0.1) +
    geom_smooth(se=F, method=glm, 
        formula=y ~ x + abs(x - 0),
        method.args = list(family = "binomial"),
        alpha=0.1) +
    ylab("consideration probability") +
    control_colors

agg_consideration_model = agg_eval %>% 
    glm(considered ~ control * (zscore(agg_evaluation) + zscore(abs(agg_evaluation))), family=binomial, data=.)

m = agg_eval %>% 
    glm(considered ~ control * (zscore(evaluation) + zscore(abs(evaluation))), family=binomial, data=.)

summ(agg_consideration_model)
# plot_coefs(consideration_model2, omit.coefs=c("controlhigh", "(Intercept)"), colors="black")
```

The model that predicts consideration probability based on aggregate outcome
evaluations has a worse AIC: 
`r round(agg_consideration_model$aic)` vs `r round(m$aic)`.
